Red Wine 1.0.0
===================


Hey! here is my first wordpress theme "Redwine". This theme is in BETA mode and not fully responsive. But still it is ready to serve for your blog.

If you have blog which's general purpose is like online books, generals etc. then this theme is best choice for you. There is no widget section in this theme so user can read content without any disturbance like advts. or  etc.

Color scheme is fairly light and clear, so user can read without eye straisness.
